        "- **Intercept**: The intercept of -24.4341 indicates the log-odds of the baseline category (high_calories = 0) when all other predictors are zero.\n",
        "- **cal_fat**: For every one unit increase in cal_fat, the log-odds of high_calories increases by 55.6569, holding all other predictors constant.\n",
        "- **trans_fat, sodium, total_carb, fiber, sugar, protein, vit_a, vit_c, calcium**: The coefficients for these variables represent the change in log-odds of high_calories for a one-unit increase in each variable, holding all other variables constant.\n",

        "- **trans_fat, sodium, fiber, sugar, vit_a, vit_c, calcium**: These variables have p-values greater than 0.05, indicating that they are not statistically significant in predicting high_calories.\n",

        "### Skew and Kurtosis:\n",
        "- **Skewness**: The skewness value of -0.876 indicates a slight left skew in the data.\n",
        "- **Kurtosis**: The kurtosis value of 7.762 indicates a sharp peak in the distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Durbin-Watson:\n",
        "- The Durbin-Watson score of 1.996 indicates positive autocorrelation in residuals.\n",

        "### Interpretation:\n",
        "- The model is statistically significant (LLR p-value: 1.310e-122) and explains 86.4% of the variance in high_calories.\n",
        "- Some parameters may not be identified due to complete quasi-separation in the data, where a fraction of observations can be perfectly predicted.\n",

The top node (also known as the root node) represents the initial split, which is usually based on the feature with the strongest association with the target variable.
